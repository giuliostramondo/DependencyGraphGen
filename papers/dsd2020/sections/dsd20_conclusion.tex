\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
In this work, we presented \frameworkname, a novel framework for co-designing memory-aware custom processors.
%with a two-level memory system. .
%Our framework enables the automatic design of a broad range of application-specific processors, using a two-level memory system.
The framework enables design-space exploration of spatial processor architectures including the memory system. We have empirically demonstrated that different spatial processor architectures can be quickly implemented using our novel PE hardware template. Lastly, we have shown the capabilities of the framework using a case study, which illustrate the sanity of our DSE approach and its ability to facilitate a comparison between the use of MRAM and SRAM technologies.
For example, we were able to conclude that, for a matrix vector multiplication 10x10, the most energy efficient architecture generated with \frameworkname~with MRAM L2M has 45\% higher latency than the best SRAM counterpart, with 25\% decrease in power consumption.

Our future work focuses on the use \frameworkname~to analyze multiple applications. In addition, we plan to enhance our framework adding the capability of automatically \textit{merging} multiple spatial processor architectures, to generate a single \textit{multi-application spatial processor}.
