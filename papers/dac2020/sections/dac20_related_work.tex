Prior art on design-space exploration of custom or domain-specific processors~\cite{Jordans2014,EusseSAMOS2014,Jozwiak2013} aims to find the optimal processor architecture in terms of area usage, power consumption and execution cycles. Processors with Single Instruction Multiplie Data (SIMD) or Single Instruction Multiple Threads (SIMT) are typically used for data-flow or streaming applications. SIMD and SIMT architectures are not scalable due to a single Instruction Memory. Spatial architecutres~\cite{7284058,8686088} helps to distribute the Instruction Memory and achieve a higher clock speed. State-of-the-art Spatial archiectures are designed for maximum flexibility and provide connections from any ALU or PE to any other using an interconnect. Prior art on using non-volatile memories as a replacement L2 memory perform co-simulation of the processor and the memory system and optimizes the cache replacement policies~\cite{4798259,7092595,6271803,7360193,200116,Patel2016ReducingSL,Komalan:2014,Mittal13f}.
