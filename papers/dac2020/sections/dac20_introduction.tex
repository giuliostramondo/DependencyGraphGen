\section{Introduction}
This work starts from the following two observations:
\begin{itemize}
\item The memory system and the processing system are \textit{interdependent} and therefore they should be \textit{co-designed}.
\item The \textit{data dependencies} of the fixed application impose constaints on the design of both memory and processing systems.
\end{itemize}

Starting from our observations we designed and implemented a framework, which the remaining of this paper describes in detail, which brings the following contributions:
\begin{itemize}
\item Modeling of different kind of memory technologies (MRAM,SRAM,eDRAM, etc..).
\item Modeling of different layers of memory having different clock speed, read/write latency and datawidth.
\item Automated exploration of different area/latency tradeoffs.
\item Custom processor design and implementation.
\end{itemize}
