Application-specific hardware is an effective way to face the increasing demand in performance and power. There is a wide range of choices to consider throughout the design and implementation phases. In this paper, we define a space of application-specific hardware generated from an input application and a methodology to explore these solutions. We demonstate empirically that these solutions can be implemented in hardware using our hardware templates. Our approach allows the exploration of hardware design parameters and enables the analysis of latency, area and power tradeoff. To demonstrate the potential of our approach we assess the benefit of Magnetoresitive RAM over Static Ram for a use case application.
