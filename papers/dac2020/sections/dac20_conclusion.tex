\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
In this work, we presented \frameworkname~a novel framework for co-designing memory-aware custom processors.  
%with a two-level memory system. . 
%Our framework enables the automatic design of a broad range of application-specific processors, using a two-level memory system. 
The framework enables design space exploration of different hardware technologies and \textit{co-designs} the memory system and the custom processor. We have empirically demonstrated the implementability of the generated architectures using our functional unit hardware templates. Lastly, we have shown the capabilities of the framework using three case studies, which illustrate the sanity of our DSE approach and its ability to facilitate a comparison between the use of MRAM and SRAM technologies.  
For example, we were able to conclude that for a matrix vector multiplication 10x10 the most energy efficient architecture generated with \frameworkname~with MRAM L2M has \textbf{45\% higher latency than the best SRAM counterpart, with 25\% decrease in power consumption}. 

Our current work focuses on automating the generation of the RTL implementation of the architectures generated by \frameworkname~using the presented hardware templates. In the near future, we plan to enhance our framework adding the capability of automatically \textit{merging} multiple application-specific architectures, generating \textit{multi-application application-specific hardware}.
