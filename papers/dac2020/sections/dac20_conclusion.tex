\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
We presented \frameworkname~a framwork for the design space exploration of  memory-aware custom processors. Our framework allows to automatically design an application-specific processor using two levels of memories. The framework enables the design space exploration of different hardware technologies and \textit{co-designs} the memory system and the custom processor. We have empirically demonstrated the implementability of the generated architecture using our functional unit hardware templates. Lastly, we have shown the capabilities of the framework using three case studies, where we where able to obtain quantitative insights over the use of the MRAM technology against SRAM for a use case applcation. 
We are currently working on automating the genration of the RTL implementation of the architectures generated by \frameworkname~using the presented hardware templates. In the near future, we plan to enanche our framework adding the capability of automatically \textit{merging} multiple application-specific architectures, generating \textit{multi-application application-specifc hardwares}.
