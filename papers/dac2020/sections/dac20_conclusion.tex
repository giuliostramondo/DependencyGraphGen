\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
In this work, we presented \frameworkname~a framework for the design space exploration of  memory-aware custom processors. Our framework allows to automatically design a range of application-specific processor using two memory levels. The framework enables the design space exploration of different hardware technologies and \textit{co-designs} the memory system and the custom processor. We have empirically demonstrated the implementability of the generated architecture using our functional unit hardware templates. Lastly, we have shown the capabilities of the framework using three case studies, which provided quantitative insights into the use of the MRAM technology against SRAM for a use case application. As an example, were able to conclude that for a matrix vector multiplication 10x10 the most energy efficient architecture generated with \frameworkname~with MRAM L2M has \textbf{45\% higher latency than the best SRAM counterpart, with 25\% decrease in power consumption}. 

We are currently working on automating the generation of the RTL implementation of the architectures generated by \frameworkname~using the presented hardware templates. In the near future, we plan to enhance our framework adding the capability of automatically \textit{merging} multiple application-specific architectures, generating \textit{multi-application application-specific hardware}.
