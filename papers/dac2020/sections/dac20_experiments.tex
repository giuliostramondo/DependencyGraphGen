\section{Experiments}
This section will give an explanation on the two experiments performed using the framework.
The first part of the section will describe the experimental setup common to the two experiments which was used.
The two subsection will dive in:
\begin{itemize}
	\item MRAM vs SRAM layer 2 memory
	\item SRAM clock exploration on layer 2 memory
\end{itemize}
